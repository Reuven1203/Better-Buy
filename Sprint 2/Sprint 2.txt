<<Plan for Sprint 3>>
The plan for Sprint 3 will be to add any TA feedback from the previous sprint.
During Sprint 3, a lot more elaboration will be added to the user stories such as deeper explanations, breakdowns of what needs to be done, and how it will be done in the code.
These will also include more details on testing to ensure code quality.
